# Polish_companies_Bankruptcy

Mini machine learning project playing with feature and model selection

Data Source: [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data#)

### What this project does

Variety factors can lead to failure in business performance. Detecting the pattern from the financial report can help detecting potential bankruptcy companies and provide timely consultant. My project is an exploration of the Polish companies Bankruptcy data, applies some models to find out which one can provide the best prediction of bankruptcy.

### How to run the analysis from beginning to end

1. First, download the data from this [link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data#) of **UCI**
2. After download and unzip the file, choose the 3year.arff file as the data file only. This data contains financial rates from 3rd year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 3 years. The data contains 10503 instances (financial statements), 495 represents bankrupted companies, 10008 firms that did not bankrupt in the forecasting period. 
   -  If you want to choose other year, it's okay, but the datafile name in the jupyter notebook should be changed accordingly.
3. Run the [jupyter notebook](), the link to the report will be included in the end of the notebook
4. OR you can open the [report](), the link to the jupyter notebook will be also included in the end of the report.
